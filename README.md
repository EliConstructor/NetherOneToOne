Hacked together mod that removes the 1:8 travel ratio between the nether and overworld.

This is a pretty jank mod that disables the nether travel ratio, so that one block in the nether is one block in the overworld. I did this in a really hacky way so it might be unstable. Also I'm pretty sure that this will affect all dimensions and make the ratio 1:1.
